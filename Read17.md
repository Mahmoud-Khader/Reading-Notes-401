**1. Describe “The Cloud”**
* *it is a computer that you used but this computer exists in another place than you.*

**2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**
* *A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.*

**3. What is auto-scaling?**
* *it is a process in the cloud computing that increase the capacity of the instances dynamicaally when our application need that.*

**4. What is bandwidth?**
* *Bandwidth is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time. Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps).*

**5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?**
* *The three biggest cost centers related to a cloud environment include network, compute, and storage.*

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Server Instances**
* *the partition of a computer that you used on the cloud.*

**Containers**
* *A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.*

**Cloud Services**
* *the services that you can do on computers online not locally.
or Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet.*

**Cloud Architecture**
* *Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network.*

**AWS**
* *Amazon web Services, it is a platform that provide a cloud computing services in general.*

**EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku**
* *both of them consider as a Paas, platform as a service.*
* *we use them to deploy our backend-server in general. but in EB we can deploy even fron-end but in Heroku we can't.*
* *autoscalling in EB, but manual scalling in Heroku.*
