# Implementation: Linked Lists

## Linked Lists

## What is a Linked List?

* *A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:*

* *data structures :ways of organizing our data.*
* *linked lists are a linear data structure, that means we traversed over the data sequentially.*
* *arrays and linked lists are linear data structure.*
* *array is a static data structure, that means when the array created will allocate a certain space in memory, and this will be fixed even the number of elements inside the array decreased or increased. and every time will allocate the same space directly.*
* *linked lists are a dynamic data structure, that means every time we add a new element or node inside the linked list will allocate a small space for this element only, and every element will take a special space for it when it's created.*
* *also in dynamic data structure, the allocated spaces will be in different places depending on the element itself. but in static will be at the same place.*

* *Big O determine how much the time & space we need to run this algorithm.*
* *Big O Notation is a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm.*
* *O(n) : means that as our input grows, the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.*
* *O(1) : means i need a constant time & and same space, and doesn't matter how much the elements we have or how huge our input is.*

* *a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.*
